# Crescent — AI Handoff

> This file is the shared short-term memory between AI coding sessions.
>
> It describes the current state, not the entire history of Crescent.
> Replace/update it when the active task changes.

## Current State

**Branch:** `develop`

**Current phase:** v0.x compiler development

**Active area:** Compiler / language implementation

**Current task:**
No active task yet. Choose the next item from `TODO.md` before beginning work.

---

## Repository Reality

Crescent currently contains:

- a handwritten lexer;
- a recursive-descent parser;
- an AST;
- multi-file module resolution;
- a semantic checker;
- JavaScript code generation;
- a reactive runtime;
- example `.crs` programs;
- compiler and browser/DOM smoke tests.

Important documentation:

- `docs/Crescent_Design.md`
- `docs/Crescent_Grammar.md`
- `compiler/README.md`

The design and grammar documents should be consulted before changing language behavior.

## Important Decisions

Record decisions here when they affect future implementation.

Current known design constraints:

- Crescent is explicitly typed.
- `state<T>` provides reactive state.
- Reactivity is intentionally shallow for objects.
- Reactive collections have special mutation behavior.
- `derived<T>` is lazy/pull-based.
- Components use `view {}` blocks.
- Styling uses component-scoped `style {}` blocks.
- JavaScript is the current v0.x compilation target.
- v1.0 requires a trustworthy semantic checker and a real editor/LSP experience.

For details, see `docs/Crescent_Design.md`.

## Known Problems

Keep only currently relevant problems here.

### Documentation consistency

The compiler README's introductory text may describe the project as having no semantic/type checker even though `compiler/src/checker.ts` exists and is documented later in the same README.

Do not blindly "fix" this without checking the current implementation and intended wording.

### Other

_No additional known blocking problems recorded._

---

## Unfinished Work

_No active unfinished implementation._

## Recommended Next Step

1. Read `TODO.md`.
2. Select one small, coherent task.
3. Read the relevant design/grammar sections.
4. Inspect the existing implementation.
5. Implement the task.
6. Run tests.
7. Update this file.
8. Commit the completed unit if appropriate.
